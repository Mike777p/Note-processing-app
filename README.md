# note-processing-app

'This is a Python project. Python was the first programming language I learnt and although I am not familar with many framworks, I wanted to build a project using Python. I am forever writing notes and have done so for many years. This has left me with thousannds upon thousands of notes that would most likely contain the answers to all my problems! Hence - The note processing app! I used Tkinter which I leanred from scratch and built a GUI to assist organising my notesd with processing and searching features. It\'s a a work in progreass but whenever I fancy coding for fun, I work on this. Click and check out the github!'
